TalkCody integrates [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting, providing real-time code quality detection similar to VSCode.

## Requirements

The Lint feature requires one of the following:

- **bun** (recommended) - Faster execution speed
- **Node.js** - Falls back to npx if bun is unavailable

Make sure bun or Node.js is installed on your system and accessible from the terminal.

## Supported Languages

| Extension | Language |
|-----------|----------|
| `.js` | JavaScript |
| `.jsx` | JSX |
| `.ts` | TypeScript |
| `.tsx` | TSX |
| `.json` | JSON |
| `.jsonc` | JSON with Comments |
| `.css` | CSS |
| `.html` | HTML |

**Note**: Biome does not currently support SCSS, Less, Markdown, and other file types.

## Basic Usage

### Automatic Detection

The editor automatically runs code checks at the following times:

- **On file open** - Initial check runs automatically
- **On file save** - Checks immediately after saving
- **On content change** - Delayed check after editing stops (default 1 second)

Detected issues are displayed with squiggly lines in the editor:
- Red squiggly lines - Errors
- Yellow squiggly lines - Warnings

### Problems Panel

Click the diagnostic badge in the editor header (showing error/warning counts) to open the problems panel:

- View all diagnostic information
- Filter issues by severity level
- Click on an issue to jump to the corresponding code location


## Settings

Open TalkCody Settings, find the "Code Linting" tab to configure:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Enable Code Linting | Global toggle |
| Show Errors | Whether to display error-level diagnostics |
| Show Warnings | Whether to display warning-level diagnostics |
| Show Info | Whether to display info-level diagnostics |

## Custom Rules

Lint automatically reads the `biome.json` configuration file in the project root directory (if it exists).

You can create this file to customize linting rules, for example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "suspicious": {
        "noExplicitAny": "warn"
      },
      "style": {
        "useConst": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
