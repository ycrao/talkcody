## What is an AI Agent?

![TalkCody AI Agents](https://cdn.talkcody.com/images/agents.png)

An AI Agent is an AI model instance with the following configurations:

- **System Prompt**: Instructions that define the agent's behavior and expertise
- **Assigned Tools**: Capabilities the agent can use (file operations, searches, etc.)
- **MCP Tools**: Custom tools added through MCP servers
- **Default Model**: The AI model that powers the agent
- **Custom Rules**: Specific guidelines for output format and behavior
- **Dynamic Context**: Whether to dynamically fetch context information for each project

Think of agents as specialized team members, each with their own expertise and responsibilities.

## Why Use AI Agents?

**Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific tasks
```
Code Reviewer → Focuses on code quality, patterns, best practices
Test Generator → Creates comprehensive unit and integration tests
Documentation Writer → Produces clear, well-structured documentation
Bug Finder → Analyzes code for potential issues and vulnerabilities
```

**Consistency**: Agents provide consistent behavior based on their configuration

**Efficiency**: Switch between agents instead of re-explaining context

**Tool Control**: Grant different capabilities to different agents

## Creating Custom Agents

<Steps>

<Step>
### Navigate to Agents View

1. Open TalkCody
2. Click on the **Agents** tab in the sidebar
3. Click **+ New Agent**
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Basic Settings

**Agent Name**
- Descriptive name (e.g., "React Expert", "API Tester")
- Appears in the agent selector

**Description** (optional)
- Brief explanation of the agent's purpose
- Helps you remember what each agent does
</Step>

<Step>
### Write the System Prompt

The system prompt defines the agent's behavior:

**Example: Code Reviewer Agent**
```
You are an experienced code reviewer focused on quality and best practices.

When reviewing code:
1. Check for bugs and logic errors
2. Evaluate code style and consistency
3. Suggest performance improvements
4. Identify security vulnerabilities
5. Recommend better patterns when applicable

Always:
- Be constructive and specific
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Provide code examples for improvements
- Prioritize critical issues over style preferences
```

<Callout type="tip">
Good system prompts are specific, actionable, and include examples of desired behavior.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Select Model

- Choose the appropriate AI model based on the task: e.g., use Main Models for complex reasoning tasks, Small Models for simple tasks
</Step>

<Step>
### Assign Tools

Select which tools the agent can use:

**File Tools**
- ✅ Read File: Read project files
- ✅ Write File: Create new files
- ✅ Edit File: Modify existing files

**Search Tools**
- ✅ Code Search: Search through codebase
- ✅ File Search: Find files by name/pattern
- ✅ Web Search: Search the internet

**Execution Tools**
- ✅ Bash Tool: Execute terminal commands
- ✅ Web Fetch: Fetch web page content

**Other Tools**
- ✅ Call Agent: Invoke other agents
- ✅ Todo Write: Manage task lists

<Callout type="warn">
Grant only necessary tools. Limiting tools reduces the chance of unintended actions.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Save and Test

1. Click **Save Agent**
2. Select the agent in a chat conversation
3. Test it with relevant prompts
4. Refine the configuration based on results
</Step>

</Steps>

## Agent Configuration Examples

### 1. Test Generator Agent

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive unit tests

**System Prompt**:
```
You are a testing expert specialized in writing comprehensive unit tests.

For each function or component you test:
1. Test happy path scenarios
2. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
3. Test error handling
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Use descriptive test names

Follow these conventions:
- Use Jest/Vitest syntax
- Organize tests with describe/it blocks
- Include setup and teardown when needed
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Write tests that are maintainable and clear
```

**Model**: Main Model
**Tools**: Read File, Write File, Code Search

### 2. Documentation Writer Agent

**Purpose**: Write clear technical documentation

**System Prompt**:
```
You are a technical writer focused on creating clear, comprehensive documentation.

When writing documentation:
1. Start with a clear overview
2. Include code examples
3. Explain parameters and return values
4. Document edge cases and gotchas
5. Use consistent formatting

Format:
- Use Markdown
- Include table of contents for long docs
- Add code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use callouts for important notes
- Keep language clear and concise
```

**Model**: Small Model
**Tools**: Read File, Write File, Code Search

### 3. Bug Finder Agent

**Purpose**: Identify bugs and security issues

**System Prompt**:
```
You are a security-conscious code analyst focused on finding bugs and vulnerabilities.

When analyzing code, look for:
1. Logic errors and edge cases
2. Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
3. Memory leaks and performance issues
4. Race conditions and concurrency bugs
5. Error handling gaps

For each issue found:
- Explain the problem clearly
- Show the exact location (file and line)
- Explain the potential impact
- Provide a fix or mitigation
- Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
```

**Model**: Main Model
**Tools**: Read File, Code Search
