## What is a Tool?

![TalkCody Tools](https://cdn.talkcody.com/images/tools.png)

A Tool is a predefined functional module that allows agents to interact with external systems:
- File system operations
- Codebase searching
- Network requests
- Command execution

Without Tools, agents can only have text conversations. With Tools, agents can truly help you complete tasks.

## Built-in Tool List

### File Operations

| Tool | Function | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Read File** | Read file content | View code, configuration files |
| **Write File** | Create new files | Generate code, configurations |
| **Edit File** | Modify existing files | Update code, fix issues |

### Search Tools

| Tool | Function | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Code Search** | Full-text search codebase | Precise code pattern matching |
| **Glob** | Wildcard file matching | Batch process files |

### Execution Tools

| Tool | Function | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Bash** | Execute terminal commands | Run scripts, install dependencies |

### Network Tools
| **Web Fetch** | Fetch web page content | Check documentation, APIs |
| **Web Search** | Search the internet | Find solutions |

### Other Tools

| Tool | Function | Description |

## How to Use

### View Current Tools

1. Click the **Tools icon** (wrench icon) in the chat interface
2. View the list of enabled tools
3. The number badge shows the enabled count

### Temporarily Adjust Tools

Temporarily enable or disable tools during a conversation:

1. Click the Tools icon to open the panel
2. Check/uncheck tools
3. Modifications only apply to the current session
4. Click **Reset** to restore defaults

<Callout type="warn">
Temporary modifications are not saved after app restart. After restart, the agent's default tool configuration will be used.
</Callout>

## Tool Permission Control

### Principle of Least Privilege

When configuring tools for agents, grant only necessary permissions:

```
Code Reviewer Agent:
✅ Read File (needs to read code)
✅ Code Search (needs to search patterns)
❌ Write File (only reviews, doesn't modify)
❌ Bash (doesn't need to execute commands)
```

## Difference from MCP Tools

| Feature | Built-in Tools | MCP Tools |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Source | Pre-installed in TalkCody | Provided by external servers |
| Type | General operations | Professional integrations |
| Configuration | Ready out of the box | Requires server configuration |
| Extensibility | Fixed functionality | Unlimited extension |
