export const PROMPT = `Use this tool to create and manage todo items for tracking tasks and progress. This tool provides comprehensive todo management:

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. **Complex multi-step tasks** - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. **Non-trivial and complex tasks** - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. **User explicitly requests todo list** - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. **User provides multiple tasks** - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. **After receiving new instructions** - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. **When you start working on a task** - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - Tests are failing
     - Implementation is partial
     - You encountered unresolved errors
     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

## Tool Capabilities

- **Create new todos**: Add tasks with content, priority, and status
- **Update existing todos**: Modify any aspect of a todo (status, priority, content)
- **Delete todos**: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks
- **Batch operations**: Update multiple todos in a single operation
- **Clear all todos**: Reset the entire todo list

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.`;
